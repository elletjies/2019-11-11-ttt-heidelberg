  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->

<p>
  The course is aimed at everyone who is
  interested in becoming a better teacher.

  This training aims to teach <strong>The Carpentries Track</strong>
  to become <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software Carpentry</a>,
  <a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentry</a> and
  <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/">Library Carpentry</a>
  instructors, run workshops and contribute to the Carpentry training
  materials, and <strong>ELIXIR Track</strong> to organise or teach at the ELIXIR
  bioinformatics or wet-biology workshops.

  You don't currently have to be an instructor or a
  teacher to attend this workshop, but you do need to be willing and
  committed to becoming one and to improving your teaching techniques.
</p>

<h3>About The Carpentries: </h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries'</a> mission is to
  help scientists and engineers get more research done in less time
  and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific
  computing.  This hands-on two-day workshop covers the basics of
  educational psychology and instructional design, and looks at how to
  use these ideas in both intensive workshops and regular classes.
</p>

<h3>About ELIXIR: </h3>
<p>
  <a href="elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a>
  unites Europeâ€™s leading life science organisations in managing and
  safeguarding the increasing volume of data being generated by publicly
  funded research. It coordinates, integrates and sustains bioinformatics
  resources across its member states and enables users in academia and
  industry to access services that are vital for their research.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>
   On the first day, we will follow The Carpentries instructor training curricuum.

  On the second day, the participants in this workshop will be divided into 2 groups.
  <strong>The Carpentries track</strong> will focus on the The Carpentries' specific curriculum for teaching programming,
  and learning about their instructor checkout process required to become a certified instructor.
  Those following the <strong>ELIXIR track</strong> will be able to choose between ELIXIR curriculum for
  teaching bioinformatics or wet-lab biology.
</p>

<p>
  This workshop is a mix of lectures and hands-on lessons where you
  practice giving a short lesson using approaches learned and
  implement some of the teaching techniques which we will discuss.
  This is training for teaching, not technical training; you do not
  need any particular technical background, and we will not be
  teaching that. This workshop is based on the constantly revised and
  updated
 <a href="{{ site.training_site }}">curriculum</a>.
</p>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<p>
  When possible, participants should bring
  a laptop that can be connected to Internet
  to follow teaching materials and developing shared notes.
  </br>
  A device for recording audio and video (mobile phones and
  laptops are OK) will also be useful as throughout the two days, we are going
  to record one another teaching in pairs or threes.  It does not have
  to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can
  understand what someone is saying.
</p>

  accessible to everybody. Please contact the workshop organisers to let them know

  ETHERPAD

  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.
